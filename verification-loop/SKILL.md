# Verification Loop

A comprehensive verification system combining periodic quality checks with mandatory completion gates.

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes.
Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

## When to Use

- After completing a feature or significant code change
- Before creating a PR
- After refactoring
- **MANDATORY** before ANY completion/success claims
- **MANDATORY** before committing, pushing, or creating PRs
- Every 15 minutes in long sessions

## The Gate Function

```
BEFORE claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:

1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: State actual status with evidence
   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim

Skip any step = lying, not verifying
```

## Verification Phases

### Phase 1: Build Verification
```bash
# Check if project builds
npm run build 2>&1 | tail -20
# OR
pnpm build 2>&1 | tail -20
```

If build fails, STOP and fix before continuing.

### Phase 2: Type Check
```bash
# TypeScript projects
npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head -30

# Python projects
pyright . 2>&1 | head -30
```

Report all type errors. Fix critical ones before continuing.

### Phase 3: Lint Check
```bash
# JavaScript/TypeScript
npm run lint 2>&1 | head -30

# Python
ruff check . 2>&1 | head -30
```

### Phase 4: Test Suite
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
npm run test -- --coverage 2>&1 | tail -50

# Check coverage threshold - Target: 80% minimum
```

Report:
- Total tests: X
- Passed: X
- Failed: X
- Coverage: X%

### Phase 5: Security Scan
```bash
# Check for secrets
grep -rn "sk-" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" . 2>/dev/null | head -10
grep -rn "api_key" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" . 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Check for console.log
grep -rn "console.log" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" src/ 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

### Phase 6: Diff Review
```bash
# Show what changed
git diff --stat
git diff HEAD~1 --name-only
```

Review each changed file for unintended changes, missing error handling, potential edge cases.

## Output Format

After running all phases, produce a verification report:

```
VERIFICATION REPORT
==================

Build:     [PASS/FAIL]
Types:     [PASS/FAIL] (X errors)
Lint:      [PASS/FAIL] (X warnings)
Tests:     [PASS/FAIL] (X/Y passed, Z% coverage)
Security:  [PASS/FAIL] (X issues)
Diff:      [X files changed]

Overall:   [READY/NOT READY] for PR

Issues to Fix:
1. ...
2. ...
```

## Common Failures

| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Tests pass | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass" |
| Linter clean | Linter output: 0 errors | Partial check, extrapolation |
| Build succeeds | Build command: exit 0 | Linter passing, logs look good |
| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |
| Agent completed | VCS diff shows changes | Agent reports "success" |

## Red Flags - STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Perfect!", "Done!")
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports
- Relying on partial verification
- Thinking "just this once"

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Should work now" | RUN the verification |
| "I'm confident" | Confidence ≠ evidence |
| "Just this once" | No exceptions |
| "Linter passed" | Linter ≠ compiler |
| "Agent said success" | Verify independently |
| "Partial check is enough" | Partial proves nothing |

## Continuous Mode

For long sessions, run verification every 15 minutes or after major changes:
- After completing each function
- After finishing a component
- Before moving to next task

## Key Patterns

**Tests:**
```
OK  [Run test command] [See: 34/34 pass] "All tests pass"
BAD "Should pass now" / "Looks correct"
```

**Regression tests (TDD Red-Green):**
```
OK  Write -> Run (pass) -> Revert fix -> Run (MUST FAIL) -> Restore -> Run (pass)
BAD "I've written a regression test" (without red-green verification)
```

**Build:**
```
OK  [Run build] [See: exit 0] "Build passes"
BAD "Linter passed" (linter doesn't check compilation)
```

---

**The Bottom Line:** No shortcuts for verification. Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result. This is non-negotiable.
