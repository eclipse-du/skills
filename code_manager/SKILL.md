# Code Directory Manager

## Purpose
To maintain a clean and organized workspace by automatically categorizing new files and projects into specific directories based on their type.

## Instructions for the Agent

**Trigger**: Whenever you are about to create a new file, folder, or project within `d:\du\code` (or the workspace root), you MUST consult this skill.

### 1. Categorization Rules

*   **AI-Generated Projects**:
    *   **Definition**: Any project, app, or script entirely or largely generated by the AI agent (you) or other AI tools.
    *   **Destination**: `d:\du\code\ai_generated\`
    *   *Example*: A new python script for data analysis requested by the user, or a new React app.

*   **Assets / Materials (素材)**:
    *   **Definition**: Static resources, reference images, raw data files, icons, or design assets.
    *   **Destination**: `d:\du\code\assets\`
    *   *Note*: Create the `assets` directory if it does not exist.

*   **Temporary Files**:
    *   **Definition**: Scratchpads, logs, quick test scripts, or intermediate files that are not meant to be permanent.
    *   **Destination**: `d:\du\code\tmp\`
    *   *Note*: Create the `tmp` directory if it does not exist.

*   **User Projects / Manual Work**:
    *   **Definition**: Projects explicitly identified as user-led or legacy code.
    *   **Destination**: `d:\du\code\user_projects\`

### 2. Execution Protocol

1.  Determining the **Category** of the file/project.
2.  **Verify** if the target directory exists. If not, create it.
3.  **Create** the file/project in the correct subdirectory.
4.  **Notify** the user of the location: "I have created the project in `ai_generated/...` to keep your workspace organized."

### 3. File System Structure Enforced

```text
d:\du\code\
├── ai_generated/       # AI Created Projects
├── user_projects/      # User Created Projects
├── assets/             # Materials/Resources (素材)
├── tmp/                # Temporary files
└── .agent/             # Agent configuration
```
